# ðŸŒŸ v2r-llm: The Magic Tool to Convert Vue Components to React Components ðŸª„

Welcome to the **v2r-llm** project! This is a magical CLI tool that can convert your Vue components into React components, and this conversion process is powered by a powerful large model! âœ¨

## Project Introduction

This project is inspired by the [vue-to-react](https://github.com/dwqs/vue-to-react) project. The code is assisted by **GitHub Copilot**, and the conversion process is supported by LLM. Thanks to these AI tools, we can easily achieve the conversion from Vue to React!

## Default Service and Model

- Default Service: `https://api.deepseek.com`
- Default Model: `deepseek-chat`

## Quick Start

If you use the default service and model, you need a **DeepSeek** **apiKey**. See the official website for application methods. Other services and models are also supported. See [transform command parameters](#transform-command-parameters) for details.

```bash
npm install -g v2r-llm
npx v2r-llm transform -i <input-vue-file> -o <output-directory> -n <output-filename> [-k <apiKey>]
```

Suppose you have a Vue component file `demo.vue`, you can convert it like this:

```bash
npx v2r-llm transform -i ./demo.vue -o ./ -n demo.js -k your-api-key
```

### Transform Command Parameters

You can use the `v2r-llm transform` command to convert Vue components to React components.

- `-i, --input <file>`: Path to the input Vue component file
- `-o, --output <dir>`: Path to the output React component directory
- `-n, --name <filename>`: Name of the output React component file
- `-k, --key <apiKey>`: (Optional) API key for authentication, can also be read from configuration
- `-b, --baseURL <url>`: (Optional) Base URL for the API, defaults to `https://api.deepseek.com`
- `-m, --model <modelName>`: (Optional) Model name for processing, defaults to `deepseek-chat`

### Config Command Parameters

You can use the `v2r-llm config` command to configure parameters, so you don't need to input `-b`, `-k`, and `-m` every time you run the transform command, or input `-k` every time when using the default service and model. For example:

```bash
# Set API key
v2r-llm config set apiKey your-api-key

# Set base URL
v2r-llm config set baseURL https://api.example.com

# Set model name
v2r-llm config set model your-model-name

# View current configuration
v2r-llm config list
```

After configuration, you can run the transform command without specifying these parameters:

```bash
npx v2r-llm transform -i ./demo.vue -o ./ -n demo.js
```

Of course, you can still use `-b`, `-k`, and `-m` for command-line configuration, which takes precedence over `v2r-llm config` settings.

## Local Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:three-water666/v2r-llm.git
cd v2r-llm
npm install
node ./bin/v2r-llm.js transform -i ./demo/demo.vue -o ./demo/ -n demo.js -k your-api-key
```
