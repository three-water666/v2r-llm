# ðŸŒŸ v2r-llm: The Magic Tool to Convert Vue Components to React Components ðŸª„

Welcome to the **v2r-llm** project! This is a magical CLI tool that can convert your Vue components into React components, and this conversion process is powered by a powerful large model! âœ¨

## Project Introduction

This project is inspired by the [vue-to-react](https://github.com/dwqs/vue-to-react) project. The code is assisted by **GitHub Copilot**, and the conversion process is supported by **DeepSeek**. Thanks to these AI tools, we can easily achieve the conversion from Vue to React!

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g v2r-llm
npx v2r-llm -i <input-vue-file> -o <output-directory> -n <output-filename> [-k <apiKey>]
```

### Parameters

- `-i, --input <file>`: Path to the input Vue component file
- `-o, --output <dir>`: Path to the output React component directory
- `-n, --name <filename>`: Name of the output React component file
- `-k, --key <apiKey>`: (Optional) API key for authentication, can also be read from environment variables

### Example

Suppose you have a Vue component file `demo.vue`, you can convert it like this:

```bash
npx v2r-llm -i ./demo.vue -o ./ -n demo.js -k your-api-key
```

## Local Development
